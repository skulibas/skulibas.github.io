This project uses the track "Traingazing" by Sam Willis and clips from the iconic anime "Your Name" by Makoto Shinkai.

I incorporated the knowledge I gained from my typography project into this one. This edit was greatly influenced by my love of minimalism and the art of clean fonts from that project. In theÂ edit's layout, I purposefully adopted a minimalistic style, making sure that each element, whether it be text or visuals, served a specific purpose and was uncluttered. I wanted to evoke a feeling of simplicity and sophistication while also reflecting the tranquil atmosphere of Sam Willis' "Traingazing" by using a simple yet elegant font. This decision not only improved the aesthetic overall but also made it possible for the music and the anime's story to flow together seamlessly.

This project served as an opportunity to practice slowing down animated characters, which is very different from motion in real life. Since animated movies have their own distinct frame rate, creating a clear slow-motion effect can be challenging. Animated characters need each movement to be meticulously adjusted frame by frame, in contrast to live-action footage where slowing down is as simple as stretching the current frames. In order to keep the characters' organic movements while adjusting to a slower time scale, this required a profound understanding of animation techniques. It was both a challenging and enlightening process.
