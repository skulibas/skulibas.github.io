summary: "\"Derivers License\" is a song that creatively delves into the topic of calculus derivatives. It was composed and directed by me, Shedrick Ulibas, and cleverly uses the melody of Olivia Rodrigo's hit song \"Drivers License\" to explore mathematical concepts, making it a unique and educational adaptation."

"Derivers License" originated as my final calculus project. I harnessed my skills in Adobe After Effects to create a captivating video that married the world of mathematics with creative expression. Using Olivia Rodrigo's hit "Drivers License" as the backdrop, I conveyed complex calculus concepts through visuals, making learning enjoyable and engaging. This project is a testament to the seamless fusion of art and math, demonstrating the potential when creativity meets technical expertise.

Creating a song with Adobe After Effects surprisingly parallels the realms of UX/UI design and web development, which are two interests in mines. Like composing a song, both UX/UI design and web development require a delicate balance of aesthetics and functionality. Video editing shares commonalities with web development, involving timelines, transitions, and visual storytelling, much like structuring web content and managing user interactions. This crossover illustrates how creative and technical skills developed in music video production can readily apply to UX/UI design and web development, underlining the value of a diverse skill set in today's job landscape.
