summary: "\"Derivers License\" is a song that creatively delves into the topic of calculus derivatives. It was composed and directed by me, Shedrick Ulibas, and cleverly uses the melody of Olivia Rodrigo's hit song \"Drivers License\" to explore mathematical concepts, making it a unique and educational adaptation."

"Derivers License" originated as my final calculus project. I harnessed my skills in Adobe After Effects to create a captivating video that showcased the world of mathematics with creative expression. I also used my skills in Garage Band to produce the song. Using Olivia Rodrigo's hit "Drivers License" as the backdrop, I conveyed calculus concepts through visuals and lyrical content, making learning enjoyable and engaging. This project is a testament to the fusion of art and math. It demonstrates the potential when creativity meets technical expertise.

Creating a video with Adobe After Effects and composing a song using Garage Band surprisingly parallels the realms of UX/UI design and web development, which are two interests in mine. Like composing a song, both UX/UI design and web development require a delicate balance of aesthetics and functionality. Video editing shares commonalities with web development, involving timelines, transitions, and visual storytelling, much like structuring web content and managing user interactions.

Video editing, UX/UI design, and web development all revolve around effective storytelling through visuals. They share a common emphasis on user-centricity, timing, and interactivity, whether it's crafting video content, designing user interfaces, or creating seamless web experiences. These commonalities illustrates how creative and technical skills developed in music video production can readily apply to UX/UI design and web development.
