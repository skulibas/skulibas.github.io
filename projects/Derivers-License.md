summary: "\"Derivers License\" is a song that creatively delves into the topic of calculus derivatives. It was composed and directed by me, Shedrick Ulibas, and cleverly uses the melody of Olivia Rodrigo's hit song \"Drivers License\" to explore mathematical concepts, making it a unique and educational adaptation."

"Derivers License" originated as my final calculus project. I harnessed my skills in Adobe After Effects to create a captivating video that married the world of mathematics with creative expression. Using Olivia Rodrigo's hit "Drivers License" as the backdrop, I conveyed complex calculus concepts through visuals, making learning enjoyable and engaging. This project is a testament to the seamless fusion of art and math, demonstrating the potential when creativity meets technical expertise.
