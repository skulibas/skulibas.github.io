Learning concepts and tutorials saw limited AI use due to the need for hands-on engagement for better comprehension.

Asking or Answering Questions in Class or Discord:
ChatGPT and other AI tools were valuable in answering conceptual questions, providing quick references, and suggesting alternative approaches. However, critical thinking and real-time interaction sometimes required human input to ensure accuracy and relevance.

Coding Examples, Explaining Code, Writing Code, and Documenting Code:
AI tools were beneficial for generating initial code examples and explanations. However, understanding complex code, writing nuanced documentation, and ensuring code quality involved human expertise. AI played a supporting role but was not a substitute for the programmer's understanding.

Quality Assurance and Other Uses in ICS 314:
AI was instrumental in quality assurance tasks, identifying errors in code and suggesting improvements. It streamlined the debugging process but couldn't replace the need for human judgment and context awareness. Other uses, such as brainstorming ideas or exploring alternative solutions, showcased the versatility of AI in complementing human creativity.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding:
The incorporation of AI has transformed the learning experience by providing instant access to vast knowledge repositories. While AI accelerated initial understanding, the depth of comprehension required additional human effort. AI served as a tool for exploration and experimentation, reinforcing theoretical concepts through practical application.

## Challenges and Opportunities:
Challenges in AI integration included the risk of dependency, potential inaccuracies, and the need for continuous refinement. Opportunities lay in leveraging AI for repetitive tasks, collaborative problem-solving, and personalized learning experiences. Striking a balance between AI assistance and human engagement emerged as a key consideration.

## Comparative Analysis:
Comparing traditional teaching methods with AI-enhanced approaches highlighted the engagement advantages of AI but underscored the importance of human creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability. While AI streamlined certain processes, the human touch remained irreplaceable in fostering a deeper understanding and mastery of software engineering concepts.

## Future Considerations:
The future role of AI in software engineering education holds promise. Advancements in AI capabilities, coupled with refined integration strategies, could lead to more personalized and efficient learning experiences. Addressing challenges, refining AI tools, and embracing a holistic approach that combines AI assistance with human mentorship would be crucial.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, AI has significantly influenced my learning journey in ICS 314, serving as a valuable tool in various aspects of software engineering. The synergistic relationship between AI and human intelligence enhances problem-solving, but a balanced approach is essential. As we look to the future, optimizing the integration of AI in software engineering education requires thoughtful consideration of its strengths, limitations, and the unique contributions of human learners and instructors alike.

## Real Essay
In all seriousness, though, I feel like A.I can either be of good and of bad, like a double-edged sword. The creation and ever-evolving nature of A.I has transformed our lives. However, the duality of A.I brings important questions about its ethical implications, especially in the realm of education.

## Not so Slay Use of A.I.
I believe the use of A.I is not a horrible thing that needs to be condemned in educational settings. I actually strongly think that A.I should be embraced and welcomed, especially in Universities and Schools. However, the reliance on AI pertaining to school work is where I would not consider a *"not so slay use"* of A.I.

One of the issues with relying on A.I in school work is the disruptance of critical thinking skills. When students turn to A.I for answers, they might miss out on the problem-solving and analytical skills that are crucial for intellectual development. A.I provides quick solutions, but the process of solving complex problems independently is important for a deeper understanding of academic content. Relying on A.I may lead to surface-level learning, blocking the development of skills necessary for growth.

Solving complex problems independently and making mistake in the processs is a great way to learn, I discovered. For instance, while learning Bootstrap in this class, I encountered numerous challenges in designing responsive web pages. Initially, I turned to ChatGPT for assistance with responsiveness. I presented the challenge, seeking help on how to make my web pages adapt to different screen sizes. However, the outcome of this attempt proved the limitations of relying solely on A.I for codes. ChatGPT suggested using media queries to overwrite Bootstraps built-in media-queries. However, as I implemented these suggestions, I soon realized that it was creating more problems as it changed the responsiveness of the other components of my web page.

This experience highlights the importance of understanding the frameworks in use and how they operate. Blindly relying on A.I can lead to more problems than there was to begin with. It became clear that while ChatGPT is a powerful tool for generating code snippets and providing general guidance, an understanding of the framework being used is essential for solving the problems that are encountered.

## Slaying with A.I. Beyond ICS 314
The use of A.I extends beyond ICS 314, as I discovered when using chatGPT for film production. Recently, I had a task of creating a project for one of my courses this semester. I decided to use the capabilities of ChatGPT to make a storyboard to make the process a little easier. Little did I know that this use of A.I. and filmmaking would prove to be a game-changer for our project.

Our film project needed meticulous planning, from the script to the scenes itself, and the storyboard played a pivotal role in guiding our team through this process. ChatGPT was immensely valuable in this process. I provided the AI with the initial concept, and it generated a detailed storyboard, complete with scene descriptions, scene sequences, and even some scripts. The storyboard still needed tweaking in the end, but the use of A.I. saved my team an immense amount of time creating the storyboard.

## A.I. Slays Traditional Teaching
Rather than condemning A.I from educational spaces, we should use it as a contemporary tool. A.I can create academic contents for instructors, allowing them to redirect their time and energy towards more meaningful interactions. A.I can also allow students to retain information faster when used correctly. Sifting through textbooks and lecture notes is the traditonal way of retaining information. These methods can be time-consuming. ChatGPT, however, provides a direct and immediate response to a question or prompt. By posing a question, students can receive concise and relevant responses, eliminating the need for extensive searches. 

However, it is crucial to acknowledge a potential pitfall in using ChatGPT: the knowledge base of the chatbot may be outdated or limited to certain topics. This is why relying on these A.I tools can be detremental.

## ~CS~ Major Slay
The prevalence of A.I tools has shifted the way computer science is taught. The allure of quick solutions and automated assistance poses a risk: the production of low-level CS majors. Students, obtaining answers through A.I, may fall into the pitfall of relying solely on these tools to navigate their academic journey. This raises concerns about the understanding and practical skills that students develop. 

The risk of over-reliance on AI, as aforementioned, needs a balance between AI assistance and independent learning. Institutions must ensure that AI is a tool for the greater good rather than a crutch that hinders the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As for a solution, I think up-to-date curriculum that aligns with the rapid evolution of technology should be prioritized. Many computer science curricula continue to rely on lectures and notes from a decade ago, potentially leaving students with outdated knowledge and inadequate preparation for the current industry landscape.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the integration of A.I in educational settings, particularly in software engineering and beyond, presents a nuanced landscape of opportunities and challenges. A.I, as a double-edged sword, has transformed our lives and holds great potential when utilized wisely. However, a careful examination of its applications reveals both the slay and not-so-slay aspects that demand our attention.
